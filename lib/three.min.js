// Three.js r128 - Minified library for 3D graphics
// This would be the full Three.js r128 minified library
// For production, download from: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js

// Placeholder comment - In production, this file should contain the complete Three.js r128 minified library
// The actual file is too large to include here, but the CDN link in the HTML will load it properly

console.log('Three.js library placeholder - replace with actual minified library from CDN');

// For deployment, either:
// 1. Download the actual three.min.js file from the CDN and place it here
// 2. Or keep the CDN link in the HTML (recommended for performance)

// Three.js functionality will be available through the CDN link in the HTML
