// GSAP 3.12.2 - GreenSock Animation Platform
// This would be the full GSAP library with ScrollTrigger
// For production, download from: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js

// Placeholder comment - In production, this file should contain the complete GSAP library
// The actual file is too large to include here, but the CDN link in the HTML will load it properly

console.log('GSAP library placeholder - replace with actual minified library from CDN');

// For deployment, either:
// 1. Download the actual gsap.min.js file from the CDN and place it here
// 2. Or keep the CDN link in the HTML (recommended for performance)

// GSAP functionality will be available through the CDN link in the HTML
